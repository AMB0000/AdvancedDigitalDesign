# Lab 3 — Latches, Flip-Flops, and Registers (DE10-Lite)

## 🧠 Objective
The purpose of this lab is to explore **basic storage elements** using **Verilog** on the **DE10-Lite FPGA**.  
We will design and test:

- RS Latch  
- D Latch  
- Master–Slave Flip-Flop  
- Register  

This lab demonstrates how **memory elements** are built both at the **gate level** and using **behavioral Verilog**.  
Results will be shown on **LEDs** and **7-segment displays**.
